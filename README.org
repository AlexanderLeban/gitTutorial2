* Introduction 
This is the repo for homework 1, the generation of a seemingly random data set.

This is the README file for homework #1.  Everyone is going to create
a fork of this repository and create a directory whose name is
<your_name> where your last name is separated from your first with an
underscore "_".  Once you have done this copy the tab separated values
file (tsv) with your data to the file and send me a pull request from
your master to add it to the repo.

I will add tutorials over the next few days.

* Set up your github account

After you set up the github account and email me.  You will get a
github invite. Accept that invitation.  The next thing you should do is 
fork the repository.  That means that you create your own copy of the
repository.

Now on your machine.  You need to download git to your local machine.
There are several ways to do this.

* Mac and windows

Double click on the downloaded file and install in the usual way.
** Windows

Double click on the downloaded file and install in the usual way.

* Configure git on your local machine [Don't skip]
** On your machine open a terminal

* Decide where to place your files
** Mac OS X

You documents are in /Users/<your name>/Documents.  In the terminal type:

=cd Documents=

** Windows

Your Documents are in C:\Users\<your name>\Documents.  In the terminal type:

=cd Documents=

* Set global git variables
Tell Git your name so your commits will be properly labeled. Type everything after the $ here:


=$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"=

Tell Git the email address that will be associated with your Git
commits. The email you specify should be the same one you used to sign
up for GitHub.

=git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"=
 
* Clone the repository from your github account to your local machine

At the prompt type:

=git clone git@github.com:cuny-ml-f2014/homework1.git=

Now you have your own copy of the repo both on your machine and in your github account.
You can look at any of the files
