This is the repo for homework 1, the generation of a seemingly random data set.

This is the README file for homework #1.  Everyone is going to create
a fork of this repository and create a directory whose name is
<your<sub>name</sub>> where your last name is separated from your first with an
underscore "\_".  Once you have done this copy the tab separated values
file (tsv) with your data to the file and send me a pull request from
your master to add it to the repo.

I will add tutorials over the next few days.
